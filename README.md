At present, I am purchasing my B.Sc. on Mechanical Engineer as a 4<sup>th</sup> year student. Though I am a student of Mechanical Engineer, my passion was always on computer technology. Since 2012, I have been trying hard to develop myself as a tech developer. As a result, I've learned and developed various interest over fields like AI (Machine Learning, Autonomous Technology), Virtual Reality (VR, AR, XR etc), 2D & 3D game, Graphics Designing, Internet of things(IOT) etc. I hope to combine these skills in solving various problems of our times through technology.
